**# How it Works

The OpenCV PPT Controller utilizes computer vision to interpret hand gestures captured by a webcam, enabling seamless control of PowerPoint presentations. The system works by analyzing real-time video frames, identifying specific gestures, and triggering corresponding actions within the presentation.

# Features

- *Gesture Control:* Navigate through PowerPoint slides by swiping right or left, and pause/resume the presentation with a fist gesture.
  
- *Customizable Sensitivity:* Adjust gesture sensitivity through the configuration file to fine-tune the controller's responsiveness.

- *User-Friendly:* Intuitive hand gestures make the presentation control natural and straightforward.

# Technology Used

- *OpenCV:* Employs the Open Source Computer Vision library for image processing, enabling the detection and interpretation of hand gestures.

- *Python:* Developed using the Python programming language for its versatility and ease of integration with OpenCV.

- *NumPy:* Utilizes NumPy for efficient array manipulation and mathematical operations, enhancing the performance of gesture recognition.
